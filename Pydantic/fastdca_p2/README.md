🚀 What is Pydantic?
Pydantic is a data validation and settings management library for Python. It uses Python type annotations to define data schemas, providing:

Type Safety: Ensures that data conforms to specified types.

Automatic Type Conversion: Converts input data to the appropriate types when possible.

Detailed Error Reporting: Provides clear error messages for invalid data inputs.

Nested Models Support: Handles complex, nested data structures seamlessly.

Serialization: Easily converts models to JSON for API responses.

Default Values & Optional Fields: Simplifies schema definitions with default and optional fields.

Custom Validators: Allows for custom validation logic tailored to specific requirements.

In the context of DACA, Pydantic is crucial for validating agent inputs and outputs, ensuring that data structures are consistent and reliable throughout the system.

🧰 Key Features
✅ Type-Safe Validation
Pydantic enforces data types using Python's type hints, ensuring that each field in a model receives data of the expected type.

🔄 Automatic Type Conversion
When possible, Pydantic automatically converts input data to the specified types. For example, a string "123" can be converted to an integer 123.

🛠️ Custom Validators
Pydantic allows the creation of custom validation logic for more complex scenarios, enabling developers to enforce specific constraints beyond basic type checks.

📦 Nested Models
Pydantic supports nested models, allowing for the validation of complex data structures where models contain other models as fields.

📤 Serialization
Models can be easily serialized to dictionaries or JSON, facilitating seamless integration with APIs and other systems that require structured data formats.

📘 Example Usage
Here's a basic example demonstrating how to define a Pydantic model and validate data:

python
Copy
Edit
from pydantic import BaseModel, ValidationError
from typing import Optional

class User(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    email: str
    age: Optional[int] = None  # Optional field with default None

# Valid data
user_data = {"id": 1, "name": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com", "age": 25}
user = User(**user_data)
print(user)
print(user.model_dump())

# Invalid data (will raise an error)
try:
    invalid_user = User(id="not_an_int", name="Bob", email="bob@example.com")
except ValidationError as e:
    print(e)
In this example, Pydantic validates the User model, ensuring that id is an integer, name and email are strings, and age is an optional integer. If invalid data is provided, a ValidationError is raised with details about the issue.
